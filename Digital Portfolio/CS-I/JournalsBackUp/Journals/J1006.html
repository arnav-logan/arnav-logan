    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What is Git communicating to you?</h3>
    <p>Git is communicating the info for the file.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>The hash for the commit is in both commands, though it is only the first 7 characters in the git commit command.</p>
    <h3>Question 3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>So it is possible to confirm which commit is the most recent one when using the log command.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They are both unsaved and displayed in red text.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>No, file1 is tracked but hasn't been updated and file2 is untracked.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>They are both saved now and displayed in green text.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>The modifications have been updated and file1 is tracked while file2 is being added</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>Two files, file1.txt and file2.txt</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>file1 is is being commited for the second time and file2 is being added. The green text is what new text is being added to the file so it is different for both files.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 5</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Execute the commands: git diff and git dif --cached. What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>Git does not say that anything has been saved because the files have already been commited</p> <br>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that github can be used to store file versions for editing without losing data.</p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when answeing questions in the Journal and swapping back to the directory.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by explaining what is happening in more detail.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that git can be useful for editing files.</p>
