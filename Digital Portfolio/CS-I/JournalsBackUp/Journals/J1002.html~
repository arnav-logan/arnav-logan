      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model.</h3>
      <p>Two services that I use which are implemented using a client-server model are: Youtube, GeforceNow.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
      <p>Yes, The ability of two different users creating a directory with the same name is useful because it allows users to make directories with any name and not have to worry about unique directory names.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 3</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
      <p>The home directory probably has a special symbol so it is easy to identify.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 4</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h3>
      <p>The prompt changed, it is useful because it always shows your current directory.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 5</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: What happens each time you press the up arrow key?</h3>
      <p>Pressing the up arrow key cycles forward through previous commands.<p>

      <h3>Question 2: What happens each time you press the down arrow key?</h3>
      <p>Pressing the down arrow key cycles back through prevoius commands.</p> <br>
	
      <h2>Section 6</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
      <p>The text was not printed to the screen because it got redirected into the file.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 7</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
      <p>The ls command prints everying in the current directory while the tree command prints everything below a specified directory.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
      <p>You would use the ls command to look at just one directory and the tree command to look at multiple directories.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 8</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
      <p>The argument to the sleep command specifies the time waited before returning.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
      <p>I am able to prove my hypothesis by seeing that a higher number argument to the sleep command waits a longer time.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 9</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h3>
      <p>The job runs in the background so the shell does not need to wait for it.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
      <p>I think that running a job in the background means that it does not pause the main system.</p>

      <h3>Question 3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
      <p>The number in the bracket is the job number, starting from 1 and going up.</p> <br>

      <h2>Section 10</h2>
      <h3>Question 1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
      <p>The jobs command shows all current running jobs and all finished jobs.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
      <p>The jobs command lists running jobs and which ones are finished.</p> <br>

      <h3>What did I learn? What is the 'big idea'?</h3>
      <p>How the shell works and commands for it.</p> <br>

      <h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
      <p>Some commands were not explained in detail so I was confused on how they fully work.</p> <br>

      <h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
      <p>By making a list of shell commands so they are easier to remember.</p> <br>

      <h3>Free reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
      <p>I learned that the shell can be used for a variety of uses</p>
