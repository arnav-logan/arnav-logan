    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
    <p>A = 1 and B = 1</p>
    <h3>Question 2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
    <p>A = 1 and B = 0 or A = 0 and B = 1</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
    <p>They are the same.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Why is this true?</h3>
    <p>Because the first four rows don't require a carry to be added so they will work on both adders.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
    <p>Because it will not have a carry due to being the first digit.</p>
    <h3>Question 2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not? </h3>
    <p>No, because the carries need to be added at the end. </p>
    <h3>Question 3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C subscipt 15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
    <p>The number is being stored in the memory with an SR latch, M+.</p> <br>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how binary adders work.</p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when trying to understand the ripple carry adder.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by explaining how C subscript 15 can be high when the memory is being stored.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that any addition can be composed of multiple binary adders.</p>
