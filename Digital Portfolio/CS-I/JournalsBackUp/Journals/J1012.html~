    <h1>CS-I Journal J1012: Alternative Base Addition</h1>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>Add the numbers togther per digit starting from the rightmost value, then carry over numbers that go over the max value of the base.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>The numbers only go from 0 to 7 so values above 7 get carried over. Ex: 7 + 3 = 12, 1 gets carried over.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>The numbers go from 0 to 15 so only values above 15 will take two digits and get carried over. Ex: 13 + 5 = 12.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 4</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>The numbers are only 0 and 1 so any number above 1 gets carries over. Ex: 1 + 1 = 10. Numbers that are higher than 1 + 1 are common so add a one after when there are three 1s. Ex: 1 + 1 + 1 = 11.</p> <br>
    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to add numbers that are in octal, hexadecimal, and binary bases.</p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when understanding how numbers carry over in other bases.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by maybe converting the numbers to decimal at the end to more easily see how they have changed.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that adding in the decimal base follows a pattern, so adding in other bases have patterns as well.</p>
