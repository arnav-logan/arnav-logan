     <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned how to use the falsad editor to make circuits.</p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when understanding how to make different gates just with NAND gates.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by maybe explaining in further detail how to use mulitple NAND gates together.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that logic gates can be combined to form any other logic gate which shows the connectivity of them.</p>
