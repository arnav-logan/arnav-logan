    <h1>CS-I Journal J1013: Boolean Algebra</h1>

    <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
    <p>I assisted: No one</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction ≠?</h3>
    <p>Because the output is true of either of the inputs are true but also when but both inputs are not true. The not equal to sign can be used to show how both inputs cannot be true because they would be equal to each other.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2ⁿ?</h3>
    <p>Becuase the ouputs are dependent on the inputs and each imput has a corresponding output. </p> <br>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about boolean algebra functions. The "big idea" is truth tables and how there is an output for every input. </p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when understanding truth tables and different functions.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by adding more detail on how the different functions and truth tables work.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that boolean algebra is like math with various functions resulting in outputs.</p>
