1.1:
Two services that I use which are implemented using a client-server model are: Youtube, GeforceNow

2.1:
The ability of two different users creating a directory with the same name is useful because it allows users to make directories with any name and not have to worry about unique directory names.

3.1:
The home directory probably has a special symbol so it is easy to identify.

4.1:
The prompt changed, it is useful because it always shows your current directory.

Pressing the down arrow key cycles back through prevoius commands.

6.1:
The text was not printed to the screen because it got redirected into the file.

7.1:
The ls command prints everying in the current directory while the tree command prints everything below a specified directory.

7.2:
You would use the ls command to look at just one directory and the tree command to look at multiple directories.

8.1:
The argument to the sleep command specifies the time waited before returning.

8.2:
I am able to prove my hypothesis by seeing that a higher number argument to the sleep command waits a longer time.

9.1:
The job runs in the background so the shell does not need to wait for it.

9.2:
I think that running a job in the background means that it does not pause the main system.

9.3:
The number in the bracket is the job number, starting from 1 and going up.

10.1:
The jobs command shows all current running jobs and all finished jobs.

10.2:
The jobs command lists running jobs and which ones are finished.
